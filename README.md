# GocollateATD
This is a students industrial work experience scheme (SIWES) project,i design and implement for Gocollate Technologies limited,where i did my internshhip,as a junior product analyst.
The goCollate Attendance System is spilt into Front-end and Backend in which each exists dependently on each other.  

FRONT-END 
Using HTML5(Hypertext markup Language 5) for organization and representation of the Page elements and structure and CSS(Cascading Stylesheet) for styling of the page elements and layouts – also for page structuring.
However, the system implement the typography and grid features of Zurb Foundation framework at Zurb. And the DOM is easily parsed and traverse by the implementation and use of jQuery Libray, jQuery. Adding of New employee is done by making an Asynchronous HTTP request to the Backend Server through the use of AngularJs HTTP object.
The Front-end design make use of vector graphics and icon from fontawesome icon collection set(fontawesome). All dependencies files for the front-end exists in the folder /public/external/ in exception to Foundation framework – which was compiled along with the system custom stylesheets rules in order to eliminate needless Server Request that might slow down the server.
Using Chartjs(found at Chartjs), we are able to plot a neat Bar chart for Employees’ statistic using the data supplied by the Backend Server.

BACKEND
The system runs on XAMPP Local Server. The Backend is designed using PHP programming language while the Database used is MySQL Relational Database Management System.
